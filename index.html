        <h2>AI Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to systems that perform tasks requiring human-like
          intelligence—learning, reasoning, decision-making, and language understanding. As AI
          becomes more integrated into daily life, it’s essential to consider not only what AI can
          do but the ethical frameworks guiding its use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Core principles include <strong>fairness</strong>, <strong>transparency</strong>,
          <strong>accountability</strong>, <strong>privacy</strong>, and <strong>safety</strong>.
          These principles help ensure AI technologies are beneficial, trustworthy, and aligned with
          human values.
